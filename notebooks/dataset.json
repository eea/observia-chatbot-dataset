    "The WAVEFLOW model is designed to introduce physically consistent surface-wave forcing in ocean-only and coupled atmosphere-wave-ocean models [[1]](https://marine.copernicus.eu/about/research-development-projects/2018-2020/waveflow). The benefits of using the WAVEFLOW model include improved predictability of forecast systems and potential improvement to the circulation of the upper ocean [[1]](https://marine.copernicus.eu/about/research-development-projects/2018-2020/waveflow). Additionally, the model has been shown to reduce the differences between forecasts and analysis, with values below 0 indicating an improvement in the predictability of the system [[1]](https://marine.copernicus.eu/about/research-development-projects/2018-2020/waveflow). The model has also been tested with various domains and resolutions, including regional and global ocean-only and fully coupled atmosphere-wave-ocean forecast systems [[1]](https://marine.copernicus.eu/about/research-development-projects/2018-2020/waveflow). \n\nThe WAVEFLOW project has also delivered a major upgrade of the open-source version of WAM, v4.7, which includes the physics package from Ardhuin et al (2010) [[1]](https://marine.copernicus.eu/about/research-development-projects/2018-2020/waveflow).

    "The effects of extreme water levels on coastal communities and ecosystems are severe and far-reaching. According to the European Environment Agency, extreme sea levels can cause flooding, coastal erosion, and the submergence of flat regions along continental coastlines and on islands [[1]](https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/analysis/indicators/extreme-sea-levels-and-coastal-flooding). This can lead to the loss of habitats, human settlements, and infrastructure, as well as damage to natural systems and ecosystems [[1]](https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/analysis/indicators/extreme-sea-levels-and-coastal-flooding).\n\nClimate change is expected to have severe impacts on coastal areas, including sea level rise, storms, and storm surges, which can cause flooding, coastal erosion, and the loss of low-lying areas that host habitats of high environmental value [[2]](https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/en/eu-adaptation-policy/sector-policies/coastal-areas). The melting of glaciers and ice sheets, along with ocean thermal expansion, are the most relevant processes impacting Europe's seas, leading to changes in mean local sea levels and tidal levels [[1]](https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/analysis/indicators/extreme-sea-levels-and-coastal-flooding).\n\nThe concurrence of high sea levels and heavy precipitation can cause compound flooding in low-lying coastal areas, as seen in the catastrophic floods in Venice in November 2019 [[1]](https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/analysis/indicators/extreme-sea-levels-and-coastal-flooding). The Mediterranean coasts are currently at the highest risk of compound flooding, but climate change is expected to increase the risk of compound flooding along most European coastlines, with the largest increases being expected along the North Sea and Baltic Sea coasts [[1]](https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/analysis/indicators/extreme-sea-levels-and-coastal-flooding).\n\nIn addition to the physical impacts, extreme water levels can also have significant economic and social impacts on coastal communities. The European Environment Agency notes that around 200 million people live along the coastal zone in Europe, and damage associated with sea level rise is mostly caused by extreme events, such as storm surges [[1]](https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/analysis/indicators/extreme-sea-levels-and-coastal-flooding).\n\nOverall, the effects of extreme water levels on coastal communities and ecosystems are significant and far-reaching, and require urgent attention and action to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change.",

      "ABOUT THE OCEAN STATE REPORT\nUsed as a reference in Europe, the Ocean State Report (OSR) is an annual publication of the Copernicus Marine Service by Mercator Ocean International , which provides a comprehensive, state-of-the-art report on the current state, natural variations and ongoing changes in the global ocean and European regional seas. The goal of the Ocean State Report is to provide reliable and scientifically-assured information that draws on data and time series from as far back as the 1970s to the present. The report is written by over 150 scientific experts from more than 30 European institutions."

      "The winds themselves may have experienced feedback from the temperature patterns they induce. Air above the Arctic Ocean in June is kept cold by melting sea ice and the resulting icy seawater. A temperature rise over the Siberian land mass to the south strengthens the north-south temperature gradient, which extends along the coastline and is termed the Arctic Frontal Zone. The strength of this gradient influences the behaviour of weather systems in the region. It is, however, just one of many influences on the wind patterns.\n Other factors\nC3S data also indicate that snow cover and surface soil moisture in the Siberian Arctic reached record lows for June."

      "The effects of extreme water levels on coastal communities and ecosystems are severe and far-reaching. According to the European Environment Agency, extreme sea levels can cause flooding, coastal erosion, and the submergence of flat regions along continental coastlines and on islands. This can lead to the loss of habitats, human settlements, and infrastructure, as well as damage to natural systems and ecosystems. Climate change is expected to have severe impacts on coastal areas, including sea level rise, storms, and storm surges, which can cause flooding, coastal erosion, and the loss of low-lying areas that host habitats of high environmental value. The concurrence of high sea levels and heavy precipitation can cause compound flooding in low-lying coastal areas. In addition to the physical impacts, extreme water levels can also have significant economic and social impacts on coastal communities."

The project takes advantage of the synergy between Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 products, combining the high spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 data with the high temporal resolution of Sentinel-3 data. The methodology used to generate the multi-resolution products is based on DINEOF (Data Interpolating Empirical Orthogonal Functions), a technique for reconstructing missing data. The project also uses a Machine Learning (ML) approach named DINCAE (Data Interpolation Convolutional AutoEncoder) to generate multi-resolution products."

      "A volcanic eruption can have significant effects on the environment. The eruption can release large amounts of toxic gases, including sulphur dioxide (SO2), into the atmosphere, which can impact air quality and human health. The SO2 can also be transported thousands of kilometers away from the volcano, affecting the climate and atmospheric chemistry. Additionally, volcanic ash can have a high and long-range damage potential for health, property, and civil aviation. The oxidation of SO2 can result in the formation of sulphate aerosol, which is a key player in atmospheric chemistry and climate regulation. Sulphate aerosols can contribute to fine particulate matter (PM2.5), which can affect air quality and human health. Volcanic eruptions can also impact the ozone layer and climate, particularly if the plume reaches the stratosphere. The eruption can also have local effects, such as lava flows and deposition of ash over surrounding areas."

Rising extreme sea levels linked to anthropogenic climate warming will lead to an increasing future flood risk along the EU coastline. Ocean acidification, caused by the uptake of CO2 in the sea, has wide-ranging impacts on marine ecosystems, including reduction of the carbonate availability, which reduces the rate of calcification of marine calcifying organisms. Climate change also affects the Baltic Sea, which is one of the most polluted regional seas in the world. Additionally, climate change impacts marine life through the 'deadly trio' of ocean acidification, sea warming, and deoxygenation, which can lead to biodiversity loss, and degraded ecosystem functions and structures.
